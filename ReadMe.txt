Q. Why have two versions?
A. Because one uses alphablend api only found in win2k and above 
   which anything below that wouldn't have the api and would crash
   the app if used on it

Q. Why not just error trap it?
A. Good question... because I'm being lazy. I only actually made this
   program for myself to use and my friends but decided to share it also.

Q. Why don't you comment more code and update more often?
A. Votes encourange programmers to do better coding and most ppl only view
   the coding and 'borrow' the code if not all the code without even 
   voting. I wouldn't mind 'borrowing' if they would at least vote or leave
   a comment. By the way thank you whom do vote or comment.
